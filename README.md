# ML-Mode---Text-to-image-

Welcome to ML-Model of Image generation, a project focused on text-to-image generation using advanced machine learning techniques. This repository contains the code and resources needed to implement a pipeline that takes textual descriptions as input and produces corresponding images.

üìÅ Project Structure
- app.py : The main application file that integrates the text-to-image model and provides a user interface (if applicable).
- stabletk.py : Contains functions and utilities to interact with the text-to-image generation model.
- authtoken.py : Handles authentication tokens required for API interactions or secure functionalities.
- requirements.txt : Lists the Python dependencies needed to run the project.
- README.md : This documentation file, detailing the project and how to use it.
- _pycache_/ : Directory auto-generated by Python to store bytecode cache files.

üöÄ Features
- Text-to-Image Conversion : Generate high-quality images from textual descriptions.
- User-Friendly : Simple and modular codebase for easy integration and experimentation.
- Scalable : Designed to incorporate more advanced models or APIs in the future.


ü§ñ How It Works
1. Input : Provide a textual description of the desired image.
2. Processing : The system leverages a pre-trained stable diffusion model or custom-built pipelines to process the text.
3. Output : The generated image is displayed or saved for further use.
